## 🚀 **Included Projects**

### **1. Simple Calculator**

A basic command-line calculator that supports:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Input validation
- Continuous operation loop

A great starting point to practice functions and basic logic.

---

### **2. Number Guessing Game**

A fun guessing game where:

- The computer selects a number between 1 and 100
- You have 10 attempts to guess it
- Hints are provided (higher/lower)
- Score is calculated based on attempts

Teaches loops, conditions, random numbers, and error handling.

---

### **3. Rock–Paper–Scissors**

Play against the computer:

- Rock, Paper, or Scissors
- Best of 5 rounds
- Automatic score tracking
- Winner/loser logic

Excellent for practicing comparisons and user interaction.

---

### **4. Password Generator**

A customizable password generator that lets you choose:

- Length
- Uppercase letters
- Numbers
- Symbols

It also shows the estimated strength of the generated password.
Great for practicing string manipulation and randomness.

---

### **5. To-Do List Manager**

A terminal-based productivity tool with:

- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Clear completed tasks
- Auto-save tasks using `todos.json`

This project teaches file handling, JSON, classes, and CRUD operations.
